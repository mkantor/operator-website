<h2>Hidden Files</h2>

<p>
  File/directory names which start with <code>_</code> are hidden from routing, but are still accessible by other
  files in the content directory. This can be useful for partials, scripts, or other things which don't make sense out
  of context.
</p>

<p>
  For example,
  <a href="https://github.com/mkantor/operator-website/tree/master/content">this site</a>
  has
  <a href="https://github.com/mkantor/operator-website/blob/master/content/_header.html.hbs"
    >a file named <code>_header.html.hbs</code></a
  >
  in the root of its content directory, but requests for
  <code>GET /_header</code> will receive <a href="/_header"><code>404</code> responses</a> instead of the HTML for the
  page header.
</p>

<p>
  Additionally, file/directory names which start with <code>.</code> are always completely ignored by Operator. You
  can safely use them for whatever you want.
