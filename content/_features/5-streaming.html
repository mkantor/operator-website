<h2>Streaming</h2>

<p>
  Operator sends chunks of the response body as soon as possible. It doesn't wait for the entire response to be
  generated.
</p>

<p>
  For example, with
  <a href="https://github.com/mkantor/operator-website/blob/master/content/examples/streaming.html.sh">
    a script that gradually emits its response body</a
  >
  the client can begin processing the response while the script is still running. In this case the
  <code>&lt;style&gt;</code> elements are applied one at a time, creating
  <a href="/examples/streaming">a colorful effect</a>.
